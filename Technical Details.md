* How to send the friend requesting e-mail?  
By uncoded email. If the receiver does not have the APP, he/she can accept the request via other email agents.

* Whether it is necessary to add "secure messages" in the friend requesting process?  
The "secure messages" will increase burden to the request sender. So that in order to "hoop" more users, we will not add this function at the beginning. If we feel it is necessary to do so in the future, a "secure messages" verification may be added.

* Whether it is necessary to add interfaces to other social applications.  
It may be useful, but at the biginning we will focus more on our APP itself.

* How to import Contacts quickly?  
Analyze the emails in the email account and provide the user with the option to choose which contact to add.

* How to support multiple kinds of email accounts?  
One advantage of an open source project is that we may allow technical stuffs in companies or universities to add the required configurations (such as IP and port number) to their own email services. This will be one of the major advantages of our product.

* Whether it is necessary to merge multiple email accounts for one user?  
If we do not support such a function, then if two friends use the APP with emails the other one does not know, they may not be able to connect with each other. If we merger multiple email accounts, however, another problem may arise. If one user send a message to a friend, then which email of the receiver should be used? This may be solved by nominating a "default" email for each user. So that in conclusion, we tend to support this function.

* How to realize groupchat?  
A intuitive method is by the group-send function of emails. We may use some other techniques to delete the instant message after reading.
